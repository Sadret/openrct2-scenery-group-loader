# OpenRCT2 Scenery Group Loader Plugin

An OpenRCT2 plug-in to load and unload scenery groups and their objects.

Coming out of an idea of [SixFrags](https://github.com/SixFrags), the main purpose of this plugin is to help you handle the object selection limit by allowing you to quickly unload all unused objects of a scenery group while keeping the scenery group active in the scenery build menu, which is not possible through the object selection window.

## Installation

1. Make sure that your OpenRCT2 version is up-to-date. You need at least version `0.4.30` or a recent development version.
2. Go to the [releases](https://github.com/Sadret/openrct2-scenery-group-loader/releases) page and download the file [`openrct2-scenery-group-loader-1.0.0.js`](https://github.com/Sadret/openrct2-scenery-group-loader/releases/download/v1.0.0/openrct2-scenery-group-loader-1.0.0.js) from [release 1.0.0](https://github.com/Sadret/openrct2-scenery-group-loader/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
3. Save it in the `plugin` subfolder of your OpenRCT2 user directory.\
On Windows, this is usually at `C:Users\{User}\Documents\OpenRCT2\plugin`.\
If you had a previous version of the Scenery Manager installed, make sure to delete its file from the `plugin` folder.
4. Start OpenRCT2 and open a scenario.

## Usage
- Click a row once to load the group and all of its objects.
- Click a row a second time to unload all unused objects of that group. If all objects of a group are unloaded, the group will also be unloaded.
- Click the button in the bottom right corner to unload all unused objects and all groups without any loaded objects.
- The plugin has a keyboard shortcut to open its window, which can be assigned in OpenRCT2's settings.\
(Options -> Controls -> Shortcut keys... -> last tab -> Open Scenery Group Loader)
